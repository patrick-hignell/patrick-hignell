## About Me
I have spent the past 9 years working as a doctor, the last 4 years of which was in
psychiatry.
Throughout my life I have always been drawn to coding. Long before I went to
medical school, I was making games in GameMaker and later I taught myself how to
use Unity whilst I was at university.
Now that I have decided to have a change in career, I am wanting to pursue the one
interest that has consistently kept me engaged and wanting to learn more.
