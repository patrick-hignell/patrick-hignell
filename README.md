## About Me
I have spent the past 9 years working as a doctor, the last 4 years of which was in psychiatry.
Throughout my life I have always been drawn to coding. Long before I went to medical school, I was making games in GameMaker and later I taught myself how to use Unity whilst I was at university.
Now that I have decided to have a change in career, I am wanting to pursue the one interest that has consistently kept me engaged and wanting to learn more.

I have recently completed a 17 week coding course at Dev Academy where I worked on full stack projects (either individually, utilising pair programming or in Agile groups) capable of CRUD operations using RESTful APIs.
During the course I learned how to use HTML, JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, Tailwind, Node, Express, Knex, SQLite3, Vitest and Superagent.

I am now putting these new skills to the test and will continue to improve upon the projects below.

## Projects
## GlIGHFE 
(pronounced Glyph) was a week long group project for the final week of Devacademy Aotearoa. I had wanted to work on some form of social media for our final project and was also interested in explroing image uploading.

One of my coursemates had suggested an interesting angle for an image based social media project which was that the website should contain no words, only symbols and emojis.

I liked the challenge this presented of creating a UI which was intuitive enough that words would not be needed to navigate.

I  worked on the image upload page and post creation front and back end including creating a Cloudinary account and using Multer middleware to send image files to the platform.

Other features I worked on included the loading component, the emoji picker and some profile features such as editing the profile and adding a profile picture.

During the final showcase I presented to a group of non-coders, talking them though our tech-stack from front end to back end.
